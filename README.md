# BarCode

A Simple BarCode reader based on https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner

Seems to work OK, rather a large number of errors reported by XCODE 6.2

Needs Cordova and https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-lowlatencyaudio to be installed.

You'll need to create your own audio folder with start.mp3, read.mp3 & error.mp3, but I found some nice ones at
